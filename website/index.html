                        William helped me as a lab demonstrator in the Real Time 3D module I delivered in 2015. His hands-on programming experience,and
                        communication skills helped the students to solve specific problems in their projects, and gaining
                        further understanding in 3D graphics programming. He has also been one of the best students I have
                        ever had. He has good analytical and time management skills and was always able to deliver coursework
                        with quality standards far above the average.

                        I worked with William on a desktop-based alerting application for 6 months. During this period, I found William to be a highly motivated individual who was able to take apart a large codebase and quickly become one of the main contributors to it. William displayed sufficient attention to detail in his work and, whenever possible,took the initiative to improve the alerting application.  Given his motivation and technical as well as non-technical skills, I believe William is committed to the craft of software development and will be invaluable to any software project.
