He has been instrumental in contributing to the successful launch of our HelloUni mobile application for Welcoming Association. He is one of our best junior developers and he has great attention to detail. He is very disciplined in managing his own time without much supervising. He is very proactive in creating new solutions and is an active contributor to the team discussions. We found him to be highly motivated and intelligent and he has definitely achieved and exceeded our expectations.</blockquote><h6 class="pull-right">- Dr. Olivia Feng, CEO at ICAN Future Star ltd</h6></figure><figure class="item"><blockquote>William helped me as a lab demonstrator in the Real Time 3D module I delivered in 2015. His hands-on programming experience,and communication skills helped the students to solve specific problems in their projects, and gaining further understanding in 3D graphics programming. He has also been one of the best students I have ever had. He has good analytical and time management skills and was always able to deliver coursework with quality standards far above the average.</blockquote><h6 class="pull-right">- Pablo Casaseca, Senior Lecturer</h6></figure><figure class="item"><blockquote>I worked with William on a desktop-based alerting application for 6 months. During this period, I found William to be a highly motivated individual who was able to take apart a large codebase and quickly become one of the main contributors to it. William displayed sufficient attention to detail in his work and, whenever possible,took the initiative to improve the alerting application. Given his motivation and technical as well as non-technical skills, I believe William is committed to the craft of software development and will be invaluable to any software project.</blockquote><h6 class="pull-right">- Ali Faizan Kazmi, Technology Associate</h6></figure><figure class="item"><blockquote>William supported a group of young people to develop a web page and App to offer financial support to all young people in the Renfrewshire area. William's technical knowledge was absolutely crucial to the success of the project. He has a clear understanding of the challenges and the demands of the group and was professional and patient in exacting the information that was needed to move to a successful outcome. William has remained committed to supporting the group to maintain the site - above and beyond original expectations. He is a committed and hard working individual who is very knowledgeable in his own field. He also has significant skill in supporting others and goes the extra mile to do so.</blockquote><h6 class="pull-right">- Eileen Coll, Team Manager</h6></figure><div class="controls"><a href="#no-autoplay-1" class="control-button">•</a> <a href="#no-autoplay-2" class="control-button">•</a> <a href="#no-autoplay-3" class="control-button">•</a> <a href="#no-autoplay-4" class="control-button">•</a></div></div></section><section><h3>Get in Touch <span id="alert" class="alert alert-hide pull-right">Email Sent!</span></h3><form><div class="row"><div class="six columns"><label for="exampleEmailInput">Your email</label><input id="email" class="u-full-width" type="text" placeholder="example@email.com" id="exampleEmailInput"></div><div class="six columns"><label for="exampleRecipientInput">Contact reason?</label><select id="reason" class="u-full-width" id="exampleRecipientInput"><option value="question">Questions</option><option value="work">Work</option><option value="info">Info</option></select></div></div><label for="message">Message</label><textarea id="message" class="u-full-width" placeholder="Hi William…" cols="5"></textarea><div class="row text-center"><input id="submit" class="button-primary" type="submit" value="Send"></div></form></section><section class="footer u-full-width"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="twelve columns text-center"><h6>&copy 2017 William Taylor</h6></div></div></div></section></div><script>window.noZensmooth = true</script><script src="build/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
