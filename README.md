To help promote my work and appear more professional I created this portfolio website. It tracks my GitHub work and my status on LinkedIn and provides links to projects I have worked on as well as a form for contacting me directly and a map for showing where I am based.

## Overview

The current version is built with Angular and Bootstrap and uses Webpack for module bundling. Animations are done with the Animate.css library which provides raw CSS animations that work across multiple browsers. I also use the GitHub Activity Feed library for tracking GitHub work and I also use a LinkedIn plugin that displays a card to my current LinkedIn page. All this is hosted using an AWS EC2 instance where a Node.js server serves the website to viewers it also deals with sending emails using forms on the website.

## Features

* LinkedIn integration
* Video playback
* Contact forms
* GitHub feed

## Development

In 2017, I decided it was time update my portfolio website for a number of reasons. First of all it is a rather heavy website which could be streamlined to be more professional and more performant. Also because I am no longer a student and I thought a graduate website would look very different.

* New lightweight website
* New modern design
* Integration with GitHub
* Custom written CSS
