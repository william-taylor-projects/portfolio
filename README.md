This is my personal portfolio website which just advertises myself and my skills for future employment should it be needed. The website is also a technical exercise that shows how small a website can be if planned and bundled properly. The build of my portfolio website is smaller than the JQuery minified library, something most websites include by default. This is done by scrapping shims for ES6 features, choosing CSS over complex JavaScript libraries and embedding icons in memory instead of standalone requests.
